This is the Microsoft "devcon" utility, which as far as I know is
fair game to redistribute. It's packaged with OpenVPN and several
other things and also distributed in source code form as an example
program by Microsoft.

It's called by zerotier-one.exe to automagically install and remove
instances of the tap device.
