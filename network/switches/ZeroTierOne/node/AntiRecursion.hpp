 * Filter to prevent recursion (ZeroTier-over-ZeroTier)
 *
 * This works by logging ZeroTier packets that we send. It's then invoked
 * again against packets read from local Ethernet taps. If the last N
 * bytes representing the ZeroTier packet match in the tap frame, then
 * the frame is a re-injection of a frame that we sent and is rejected.
 *
 * This means that ZeroTier packets simply will not traverse ZeroTier
 * networks, which would cause all sorts of weird problems.
 *
 * NOTE: this is applied to low-level packets before they are sent to
 * SocketManager and/or sockets, not to fully assembled packets before
 * (possible) fragmentation.
