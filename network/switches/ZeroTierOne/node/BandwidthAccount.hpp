 * Bandwidth account used for rate limiting multicast groups

 * This is used to apply a bank account model to multicast groups. Each
 * multicast packet counts against a balance, which accrues at a given
 * rate in bytes per second. Debt is possible. These parameters are
 * configurable.
 *
 * A bank account model permits bursting behavior, which correctly models
 * how OSes and apps typically use multicast. It's common for things to
 * spew lots of multicast messages at once, wait a while, then do it
 * again. A consistent bandwidth limit model doesn't fit.
