 * The handler method takes the following arguments: an arbitrary pointer, an
 * HTTP response code, the URL queried, whether or not the message body was
 * stored on disk, and the message body.
 *
 * If stored on disk, the body string contains the path and the file must be
 * moved or deleted by the receiver when it's done. If an error occurs, the
 * response code will be negative and the body will be the error message.
 *
 * All headers in the returned headers map will have their header names
 * converted to lower case, e.g. "content-type".
 *
 * Currently only the "http" transport is guaranteed to be supported on all
 * platforms.
