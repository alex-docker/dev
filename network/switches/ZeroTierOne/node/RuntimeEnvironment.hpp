/**
 * Holds global state for an instance of ZeroTier::Node

 * instances of objects that don't basically represent constants. It makes
 * unit testing, embedding, threading, and other things hard and is poor
 * practice.
 * 
 * So we put everything that we would want to be global, like Logger, here
 * and we give everybody this as _r. The Node creates and initializes this
 * on startup and deletes things on shutdown.
