/**
 * A subprocess that communicates with the host via a simple protocol
 *
 * This is currently only supported on *nix systems, and is used to implement
 * special plugins that are used by supernodes and network configuration
 * master nodes. Users will probably have no use for it.
 *
 * The simple binary protocol consists of a bidirectional stream of string-
 * serialized Dictionaries prefixed by a 32-bit message length. Input
 * messages are sent to the subprocess via its stdin, and output is read
 * from its stdout. Messages printed by the subprocess on its stderr are
 * logged via the standard Logger instance. If the subprocess dies, an
 * attempt is made to restart it every second.
